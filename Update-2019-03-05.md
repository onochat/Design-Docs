# Release version

We are using EOSIO release 1.6.1, which has some important updates
related to both performance and security.  This version will be the
bassis to launch ONOchain.

# Minimal modifications

We continue to minimize changes to the base EOSIO code base, moving all
our modifications into a combination of special accounts with special
actions, modifications to the system contracts and runtime/startup configuration options. 
We are now close to zero changes in the base code, which is our goal.

Our philosophy is to minimize the changes we make to the base code,
so that future improvements can be easily incorporated.

# Account mapping

All of our special accounts will have names of the form ono.XXX, to
clearly distinguish them from user accounts.

# EOS Mainnet airdrop

We will do the EOS Mainnet airdrop soon after launching the
ONOchain. Exchange of tokens between the EOS Mainnet and ONOchain will
be done using the BOS token migration plugin, developed for the BOS
sister chain.
