# Initial Deployment

For the initial deployment, we will implement limited functionality on the ONOchain, focused primarily on token management. 
This will allow for token migration from the existing central server to the chain, and then open those tokens 
for transfer to other users or exchanges. All token transfers will be recorded and can be inspected on the chain.
