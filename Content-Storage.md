Storage of content on ONOchain is expected to require large scale growth.
We have little confidence in the ability of a truly public distributed storage system, such as IPFS, 
to provide the scaling and performance we need to provide a responsive and high bandwidth user expereience.
We are now testing object storage using the established and open source CEPH software.
The intention is to build globaly distributed CEPH nodes, distributed and decentralized by mutliple block producers. 
This is currently under testing.

Initial testing is not encouraging, so we will continue to use existing centralized storage, while studying and testing other solutions.
