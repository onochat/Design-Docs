We have tested account creation on EOSIO up to 20 million user accounts. 
Initial testing shows that RAM requirements scale as expected.
We are now adjusting the account creation method to speed the account creation method, and preparing hardware for larger scale.
The next target test is to create about 100 million account, to confirm that it will use the expected 300 GB of RAM, 
and that transaction and query performance are acceptable with these accounts active.
